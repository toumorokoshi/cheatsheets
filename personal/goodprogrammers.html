<h3>Debug with tests</h3>
<p>When you're about to debug something, write a test to test it! This provides a great test to test this behaviour in the future, and you save yourself tons of time on doing the same workflow over and over again.</p>

<h3>Clearly identify your concerns and problems</h3>

<p>SVN Sucks! asp.net is awful! Who would ever use ruby? These are the types of statements that are just a waste of time: no one has any idea why you feel that way, and it's quite possible you don't either. Try to identify what your issues are with something. Conversely, don't just blindly going on about how you love Git, Python rocks, or C# is way better than Go. Not understanding why you like or use a technology is worse than not understanding why you dislike it.</p>
